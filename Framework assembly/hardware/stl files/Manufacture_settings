Manufacture settings
-----------------

Assembly was manufactured using a Ultimaker 3 3D-printer using standard material settings. 

Print the CAD models using any material of your choice. 

Hard materials such as ABS are recommended for printing the camera holder. We recommend using a 100% infill to provide stronger consistence to this part (it will hold the camera for long periods of time).

Black material is recommended for Petri Dish holder (to enhance contrast during imaging)
